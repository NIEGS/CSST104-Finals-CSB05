## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze student performance in exams using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a classification model, we aim to predict whether a student will perform well based on various features, such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. This analysis will help us understand the factors that influence student performance and identify areas where students may need additional support.
