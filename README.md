## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze student performance in exams using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a classification model, we aim to predict whether a student will perform well based on various features, such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. This analysis will help us understand the factors that influence student performance and identify areas where students may need additional support.

The dataset used for this project includes information about students' demographics and their scores in math, reading, and writing exams. Specifically, it contains columns for gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course status, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

The methodology for this project includes several steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Building a classification model using RandomForestClassifier
5. Utilizing various visualizations for deeper insights

## Libraries and Data Handling

### Libraries Used:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Data Loading:
Data is loaded from a CSV file into a DataFrame using Pandas' `read_csv()` function.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Basic preprocessing such as handling categorical data transformation is performed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive statistics and visualizations are generated to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

## Data Analysis Techniques

### Visualizations:
Visualizations such as line plots, bar plots, box plots, heatmaps, and pie charts are created to explore various aspects of the dataset.

### Item Analysis:
In-depth analyses are conducted to explore various aspects of the dataset including difficulty level and discriminatory power.
