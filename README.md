## 📚 Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze student performance in exams using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a classification model, the aim is to predict whether a student will perform well based on various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. The dataset includes information about students' demographics and their scores in math, reading, and writing exams. The methodology includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a classification model using RandomForestClassifier.

## 🛠️ Libraries and Data Handling
Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Basic preprocessing such as handling categorical data transformation is performed. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing data distributions, and conducting item analysis.
